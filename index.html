					<h3 class="wow fadeInDown">HOW DOES THE SALES PROCESS WORK?</h3>
					<p class="wow fadeInUp">By purchasing a Disney Vacation Club Membership through resale, you will have the opportunity to enjoy all 14 DVC properties. Like all members, you will have the benefits of Home Resort Priority, you’ll have access to Member Services and can book your family vacation by phone or online. The biggest benefit of purchasing a DVC resale rather than buying directly from Disney is the price–you will save 20%-50% off retail pricing! Members can also enjoy the thousands of resort options around the world through Resort Condominiums International (RCI). Once you find the contract that best suits your family, simply create an account. When logged in, you’ll head over to the Listings page and press the plus sign to start the offer process. After you’ve submitted your offer, the seller will receive an automated email. Once you reach an agreement, you’ll sign the sales agreement electronically and we will forward the contract to Disney for ROFR. When we receive a response from Disney on the right of first refusal, you will be notified and our title company will begin generating your closing documents. From start to finish, the closing process takes about 45 days.</p>

We have a Resale Value Calculator to assist you in selecting an appropriate price for your contract on the resale market, and we’re here to help every step of the way.

						<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Disney Activities To Do At Home</h3>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">Bring the Magic of Disney Home 
							Has your Disney vacation been canceled or rescheduled due to the effects of COVID-19? While the closure of Disney parks around the world is necessary to help curb the spread of the virus, the news saddens Disney lovers everywhere. While nothing can replace visiting the parks, here are a few ways to bring a spark of Disney magic to your home until we “see you real soon!” 
						   VIRTUAL DISNEY DAYS 
						   Modern technology and a little help from YouTube make taking a virtual park day easy! Start by listening to park entrance music from Epcot or Main Street, U.S.A. during breakfast (we suggest Mickey-shaped pancakes). Then, it’s time for rides! Virtually hop aboard popular attractions like Peter Pan’s Flight, Slinky Dog Dash, and Frozen Ever After with this Disney ride-through video list from Romper. It’s like your very own living room park-hopper pass! At 3 o’clock, gather the family around to watch the Festival of Fantasy parade. Don’t forget to end your evening with a viewing of Happily Ever After!  If watching video ride-throughs just isn’t enough to satisfy your Disney desires, you can always spend the afternoon recreating your favorite Disney attraction at home. For even more fun, have a Disney “world tour” day where you view rides, shows, and parades from Disney parks around the world. Add some nostalgia by searching for by-gone attractions like this video of the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride. Then, swap stories with your family about how the parks have changed over the years. 
						   DISNEY RECIPES & CRAFTS 
						   Disney is a foodie paradise, so any virtual park day wouldn’t be complete without some Disney snacks! Find genuine Premium Mickey Bars at your local grocery store or spend the day recreating your favorite Disney recipes. If you’re looking to test your cooking chops, try making a recipe from the parks and resorts using this comprehensive Disney recipe list. If your family is particularly crafty, spend an afternoon doing arts and crafts—Disney-style.  Disney Family has a whole section dedicated to all sorts of Disney crafts including home decor, kids crafts, and holiday favorites. 
						   DISNEY GAME NIGHT 
						   Get the kids off their screens and spend some quality family time together!  There are plenty of Disney-themed board games like Candy Land, Monopoly, and Headbanz available on Amazon.  Disney trivia and charades are other great games to play with your family. Alternatively, you can download the Play Disney Parks app and play Disney trivia from anywhere—no park admission required. 
						   THEMED MOVIE MARATHONS 
						   The new Disney + streaming service brings movie marathons to a whole other level. Spend your day in a galaxy far, far away with a Star Wars movie marathon. We’ll let you argue over what order they should be watched in. Or, view all the Disney Princess movies in chronological order and see how Disney has evolved over the years. Have a sing-along marathon with toe-tapping favorites like Mary Poppins, The Lion King, and Frozen. Or, pick a decade and watch every Disney movie from that era (90s animated movies, perhaps?).  Encourage your Jedis and princesses to dress up and make special movie-themed snacks for a fully-immersive experience. 
							CALL THE DISNEY PARKS HOME 
						    Love visiting the parks and returning every year? Now is a great time to become a Disney Vacation Club member! By joining now, you will enjoy a discount of 40-50% less than purchasing directly from Disney.

						<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">How to Sell Your DVC Membership:</h3>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">Are you looking to sell your Disney Vacation Club membership on the resale market but unsure about the process? At DVC Sales, we make buying and selling your Disney Vacation Club membership easy. Follow this step-by-step guide to learn how to sell your DVC membership.

							1. CALCULATE YOUR MEMBERSHIP’S VALUE
							At DVC Sales, you are in charge of setting your listing price, so you’ll need to spend a little time determining your membership’s potential value. Our Resale Value Calculator is a great tool to help you price your contract automatically. We’ll calculate a range of suggested per-point prices based on your specific membership. Since the number of points currently available is the biggest factor in determining your membership’s worth, you’ll want to view our current DVC resale listings for similar contracts to see what a good asking price may be.
							
							Our team at DVC Sales assists sellers in determining the appropriate price for their contract every day, so contact us if you have questions about pricing your membership.
							2. CREATE A LISTING
							The first step is to create an account. Simply click the button on the top right-hand corner of this screen. You’ll be guided through a few prompts to create an account and publish your listing on our website. To save time, make sure you have your contract and member ID number on hand.
							
							To ensure new listing accuracy, we’ll ask you for an electronic signature so we can contact Disney on your behalf for a current Point Activity Statement (PAS). This helps us verify your membership and confirm the number of points that are currently available. We do this with all new listings to confirm that all of our DVC resale listings are authentic.
							3. WAIT FOR OFFERS!
							You’ll receive an automated email or text when an offer is made on your listing. Some buyers make special requests for specific memberships. If your contract meets their criteria, they’ll receive an email notifying them of your new listing.
							4. THE CLOSING PROCESS 
							Once a buyer places an offer, you’ll be notified immediately by text or email through our automated system. You can then accept or place a counter-offer with the buyer. If both parties agree on the terms, an agreement will be automatically generated. Once signed, we’ll send you and the buyer a copy of the fully executed agreement. We will also send the contract to our title company and to Disney to start the ROFR process.
							
							ROFR stands for Right Of First Refusal and is the process of sending your contract to the Disney Vacation Club Review Board. Disney has 30 days (it’s usually less) to review the proposed terms of every contract sold on the resale market. Disney is able to step in as the buyer and they do so about 15%-20% of the time. This process ensures DVC membership prices stay in line with current resale market values. If Disney chooses to exercise the right to buy the contract back, you will receive the exact same amount of money you had already agreed upon with your buyer. Once a contract goes through ROFR, you’re one step closer to closing.
							
							From start to finish, the process typically takes about 30-45 days once a contract has been signed by both parties. As a seller, you will receive the contract price minus $150 for Disney’s ROFR and estoppel fee and our real estate commission. Buyers are responsible for reimbursing the seller for the dues for this year (based on the number of points currently available and bankable) and they pay all closing costs. This is more money in your pocket!
							Why list with DVC Sales?
							Our automated selling process makes listing your DVC membership easy. We have 600-800 daily visitors on our site who will see your DVC resale listing, and most of our inventory is sold within 30-40 days. Our commission rate is lower than many resale companies, which gives you more money in your pocket at closing. Plus, with over 25 years of experience working directly for the Disney Vacation Club, we have the knowledge and expertise necessary to assist buyers as they learn more about DVC.
							
							We have helped thousands of families purchase DVC and now, we are here to help sellers as well. Right now, we have 80 families who are waiting for the right membership to make their DVC dreams a reality—maybe it’s yours! Get started by creating an account today.</p>

						<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Royal Treatment Awaits at Disney’s</h3>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">With luxurious Disney Vacation Club accommodations, five-star dining and plenty of amenities, staying at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa is the perfect way to treat your family like royalty while visiting Walt Disney World. Only a short monorail ride to the Magic Kingdom, the Grand Floridian is styled with old-world charm, a reminder of the days when Florida was first becoming a vacation destination for the well-to-do.

							DVC Villas at the Grand Floridian include the modern amenities you’d expect from a DVC resort with well-appointed finishes. However, the rooms are only the beginning of what makes the Grand Floridian a great place to stay or call home!
							DINING
							The Grand Floridian is known for its truly exceptional dining experiences. From world-class, five-star restaurants to character dining, the Grand Floridian has it all!
							VICTORIA & ALBERT'S
							The most exclusive and finest dining on Walt Disney World property is located at Victoria & Albert’s. It has won various awards, including the AAA Five-Diamond award and the five-star rating from Forbes' Travel Guide. This dining experience is best for celebrating those special moments, from milestone anniversaries to marriage proposals.
							CITRICOS
							Another fine-dining option, Citricos blends American and Mediterranean flavors. The restaurant offers an award-winning wine list as well.
							NARCOOSEE'S
							Narcoosee’s offers dining inside a large gazebo overlooking Seven Seas Lagoon. End your romantic evening by watching the fireworks from Magic Kingdom (the music may play out on the veranda) and the Electrical Water Pageant!
							1900 PARK FARE
							1900 Park Fare has buffet character dining for both breakfast and dinner. At breakfast, beloved characters like Winnie the Pooh, the Mad Hatter, Alice, and Mary Poppins may greet you, while dinner is a royal occasion with guests like Cinderella, Prince Charming, and the Tremaine family.
							Experiences at the Grand Floridian
							At The Grand Floridian, everything about your stay is a luxurious experience. Upon entering the main lobby, you may be greeted with the sounds of a pianist or jazz band. Take a ride on the glass elevator or shop for designer clothing and accessories at the many stores within the main building. You’ll also want to visit these special places at the resort:
							SENSES SPA
							Getting pampered at this full-service spa at the Grand Floridian is a great way to relax on a non-park day. Indulge in facials, massages, manicures, and haircuts. Or, book a Character Couture experience for a character-inspired makeover, open to guests of all ages!
							BIBBIDI BOBBIDI BOUTIQUE
							Children ages 3-12 can experience being magically transformed into princesses and knights at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique’s new location inside the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. Give your little princess a royal evening by visiting the Boutique and enjoying a fairytale dinner at 1900 Park Fare.
							TEA PARTIES
							The Grand Floridian’s elegant setting makes it the perfect place for a spot of tea. The resort is host to three separate tea party experiences, each with a unique theme. Adults can sample various teas and enjoy a variety of treats, while princesses at heart can sip and snack with Princess Aurora, or children ages 4-12 can attend an un-birthday tea party.
							Planning your Disney Vacation Club stay at the Grand Floridian
							Calling the Grand Floridian home is great if you love to travel in luxury whenever you visit. It also has the lowest DVC dues at Walt Disney World. You can learn more about planning your DVC Grand Floridian vacation on our website.
							
							Bank your points and treat your entire family to a two-bedroom or Grand Villa during early December (Adventure season). Visiting at that time of year allows you to experience all the magic of the holidays at WDW with fewer crowds. Take in the smells of fresh gingerbread from the life-size gingerbread house and pose for family photos by the stunning Christmas tree.
